# Handoff — 2026-08-03 session

What this session did, what's still open, and where to pick it back up. Written so a reader who
wasn't in the conversation can continue cold.

## What happened, in order

1. **Reviewed the repo's existing labs/docs** (`docs/VISION.md`, `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`,
   `docs/PSCADOSSE.md`) to refresh the current state: 5 labs implemented, Lab 5 (DPsim EMT +
   `phase_model.py`'s one-source-of-truth waveform state machine) is the most relevant capability
   for what came next.
2. **Reviewed AEMO's 2026 General Power System Risk Review** (the real 139-page PDF, read directly
   page-by-page via the `Read` tool's PDF support — an earlier `WebFetch` attempt on the same URL
   returned confidently-worded but hallucinated generic content and was discarded; flagging this
   because it's a real failure mode worth remembering, not a one-off). Findings discussed in chat
   (not saved as a standalone doc — if that capability-mapping writeup itself is wanted as a
   committed artifact later, it should become a `docs/backlog/000X-...md` gap item, not a PRD, since
   it was an audit of what the repo does/doesn't already support, not a build plan):
   - 4 priority risks: large load (IBL/data-centre) connections, non-credible system-strength risk
     from synchronous machine retirement, large non-credible generation/network contingencies,
     voltage control risk (post-Iberian-blackout review).
   - §5.15 "Power system model adequacy and accuracy" reads almost like a checklist `docs/PSCADOSSE.md`
     already answers (version-pinned containers as a reproducibility statement, OSI-license golden
     path).
   - Concrete named gap: no fault-level/short-circuit capability in this repo despite
     `pandapower.shortcircuit` already being available via the existing pandapower dependency —
     highest-leverage, lowest-effort addition for the system-strength priority risk, **not yet
     turned into a PRD or backlog item this session**.
3. **Wrote three PRDs** in new `docs/prd/` (index: `docs/prd/README.md`), and pointed
   `docs/VISION.md` §14 at them:
   - `0001-composable-generator-detector-platform.md` — the foundation: `Generator`/`Detector`
     interfaces generalizing Lab 5's single fixed-time fault into a causally-linked event timeline,
     plus a scoring harness. This is a concrete build plan for the "subsequent phase"
     `docs/LAB5_SPARTAN_CHAOSNET.md`'s own Definition of Done already named and deferred
     (SPARTAN-style anomaly-detection logic).
   - `0002-sa-2016-black-system-cascade-scenario.md` — closes the half of Lab 4 Part C's existing
     "not a root-cause reproduction" caveat that its dispatch-reconciliation approach was never
     positioned to attempt. **Explicitly flags a required grounding TODO**: the PRD only cites
     AEMO's own GPSRR paraphrase (four confirmed causal stages, verified this session from the
     primary PDF) — it does *not* invent fault-timing/threshold numbers, and says so. Before
     implementing, pull AEMO's actual 2017 integrated final report + the AER investigation report
     (both already linked in `labs/04-aemo-digital-twin-reconciliation/README.md`) for the real
     numbers.
   - `0003-iberian-2025-blackout-scenario.md` — grounded directly in ENTSO-E's real 472-page Final
     Report on the 28 April 2025 Spain/Portugal blackout, downloaded and read this session (not a
     secondhand summary): the actual root-cause tree (11 factors) and second-by-second timeline
     (exact timestamps/MW/kV/Hz) are in the PRD's acceptance-criteria tables, with citations.
     Deliberately complementary to 0002 — a control/oscillation-driven cascade with *no* initiating
     network fault, vs. 0002's weather/network-fault-driven one.
4. **GitHub actions taken** (all confirmed with the user before executing, per this session's
   working norm — see "Working notes" below):
   - Forked `Power-Agent/PowerMCP` → `fungible-farm/PowerMCP`.
   - Filed `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#1`: propose adding ANDES (https://github.com/curent/andes) as an
     MCP-exposed small-signal/dynamic-simulation engine, tying it to the §5.15/small-signal gap
     found in step 2.
   - Filed `fungible-farm/nem-poweragent-lab#5` and `#6` for PRD-0001 and PRD-0002 respectively.
     (The repo's issue counter was already past 1 despite `gh issue list` showing none at the time —
     so "author #1 and #2" from the original request meant PRD-0001/PRD-0002, not literal issue
     numbers; noting this so the numbering mismatch doesn't look like an error later.)
5. **Ran a background planning agent** against `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#1`. It found the ANDES MCP
   server **already exists** in the fork (`ANDES/andes_mcp.py`, already wired into
   `powermcp/registry.py`/`pyproject.toml`'s `andes` extra/part of `tests/test_powerio_server.py`)
   — issue #1 is a gap-closing fix, not a greenfield build. It also flagged two claims, both
   independently verified this session directly against ANDES's real GitHub source before acting on
   them: (a) ANDES is genuinely GPL-3.0, not BSD as issue #1 incorrectly stated; (b)
   `run_eigenvalue_analysis` reads attribute names (`ss.EIG.vectors`/`.state_desc`) that don't exist
   on ANDES's real `EIG` routine (`andes/routines/eig.py`'s actual attributes are
   `mu`/`N`/`W`/`pfactors`/`x_name`) — a real, confirmed latent bug, not a missing feature.
6. **Went through Plan Mode** (`docs` at `/home/brianh/.claude/plans/dreamy-mixing-squirrel.md`) to
   scope the fix: asked the user 4 scope questions (license-correction handling, CI coverage, raw+dyr
   inclusion, eigen-analysis reload-vs-reuse) — all answered with the recommended option. Net scope:
   fix the eigenvalue bug + tests/docs for tools that already exist; correct the license claim;
   defer PSS/E raw+dyr dynamic-model loading to a follow-up issue; no CI workflow changes.
7. **Executed the plan**:
   - Posted the license-correction comment on `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#1`.
   - Filed `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#2` (PSS/E raw+dyr follow-up, explicitly deferred out of #1's PR).
   - Launched a second, separate implementation agent (full tool access) to fix
     `ANDES/andes_mcp.py`'s `run_eigenvalue_analysis`, add `tests/test_andes_server.py`, update
     `ANDES/README.md`/`powermcp/README.md`, and open a PR against `fungible-farm/PowerMCP`.
8. **Opened and independently verified [`fungible-farm/PowerMCP#3`](https://github.com/fungible-farm/PowerMCP/pull/3)**
   — did not just trust the implementation agent's self-report. Cloned the PR branch fresh into a
   throwaway location, ran `py_compile` on every touched file, grepped `tests/test_powerio_server.py`
   to confirm `sys`/`TOOLS` weren't left as orphaned imports after the refactor, and independently
   ran `pip install -e . pytest` (no extras, mirroring the repo's actual CI job) +
   `pytest tests/ -q` myself: **106 passed, 9 skipped, 0 failed** — matches the agent's claim exactly.
   Read the full diff directly; the attribute names and damping/frequency formula match what was
   verified against ANDES's real source earlier in this session. One thing *not* independently
   re-verified: the agent's claim of having installed `andes` 2.0.0 live and run it end-to-end — I
   didn't reinstall `andes` myself to re-check that specific claim, since the source-level formula/
   attribute-name verification already done this session was sufficient corroboration. `gh pr checks
   3` reported no CI checks at all on the branch (Actions may not be enabled on this fork, or the
   push didn't trigger it) — worth checking if this repo is expected to run CI on fork branches.

## In flight — do not duplicate this work

9. **Picked up `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#2` (PSS/E raw+dyr, deferred from #1/#3)** after the user
   confirmed via AskUserQuestion that this was "next," not the PRD-0003 issue or PRD-0001
   implementation (both still open options for later). Before planning, found via `gh api` that
   `andes`'s own GitHub repo already ships genuine PSS/E `.raw`+`.dyr` case pairs as example/test
   data (`andes/cases/ieee14/ieee14.raw`+`ieee14.dyr` — small, standard, canonical — plus
   kundur/npcc/wecc/nordic44 variants). This is a meaningfully better fixture source than
   hand-authoring a new raw/dyr pair (the issue's own original text proposed authoring one, before
   this finding, and separately warned "ANDES's own PSS/E dyr parser has known real-world
   compatibility gaps"). **Not yet verified**: whether the installed `andes` PyPI package actually
   ships `cases/` as accessible package data at runtime (vs. only present in the GitHub repo), and
   whether there's a documented API to reference it (avoiding any need to vendor/copy ANDES's
   GPL-3.0 files into this MIT-licensed repo at all). A second `Plan`-type agent is running in the
   background to verify this and the real `andes.run(..., addfile=...)` combined-loading API against
   a live install, then design the concrete `run_power_flow(dyr_path=...)` change,
   `tests/test_andes_server.py` additions, and doc updates.
10. **Planning agent's findings confirmed — independently re-verified, not just trusted.** Spun up
    my own fresh venv, `pip install andes`, and directly confirmed: `andes.get_case('ieee14/ieee14.raw'
    |'ieee14/ieee14.dyr')` resolves to real files on disk from the installed package; `andes.run`'s
    real signature passes `addfile` through `**kwargs`; loading `ieee14.raw` alone gives
    `ss.groups['SynGen'].n == 0`, loading with `addfile=ieee14.dyr` gives `== 5`. All matched the
    planning agent's report exactly. **Net design**: no new fixture file authored or vendored —
    tests resolve ANDES's own bundled `ieee14` case via `andes.get_case()` at test time, sidestepping
    any GPL-3.0-vendoring question entirely; `ss.groups["SynGen"].n` (not `get_system_info`'s existing
    `num_generators`, which is already non-zero from static `PV` buses alone) is the "did dynamics
    actually attach" signal; test assertions are `> 0` not exact-value, to stay robust across `andes`
    versions.
11. **Launched a second implementation agent** (background) to add an additive `dyr_path` parameter
    to `run_power_flow`, extend `tests/test_andes_server.py`, update `ANDES/README.md`, and open a PR
    — **stacked on top of PR #3's branch** (`fix/andes-eigenvalue-analysis`), since it depends on
    that PR's fix and test scaffolding and PR #3 is still open/unmerged. Told explicitly to verify
    live (real `andes` install, real test run) before reporting, not just claim it.
12. **Opened and independently verified [`fungible-farm/PowerMCP#4`](https://github.com/fungible-farm/PowerMCP/pull/4)**
    (closes #2, stacked on #3). Read the actual diff directly rather than trusting the summary — the
    `dyr_path` param, defensive `SynGen` read, and additive-only field changes all match the plan
    exactly. Cloned the PR branch fresh into a throwaway location myself and re-ran everything:
    with a real `andes` install, `pytest tests/test_andes_server.py -v` → **9/9 passed** (5 existing
    + 4 new); in a separate clean venv with no extras (mirroring actual CI), `pytest tests/ -q` →
    **106 passed, 13 skipped, 0 failed** (skip count rose from PR #3's 9 to 13 — exactly the 4 new
    andes-gated tests, consistent). `py_compile` clean on every touched file. `gh pr checks 4` was
    not run separately since the same "Actions may not run on fork branches" caveat from PR #3
    likely applies.
13. **Filed [`fungible-farm/nem-poweragent-lab#7`](https://github.com/fungible-farm/nem-poweragent-lab/issues/7)**
    for PRD-0003 (Iberian 2025), after the user confirmed via AskUserQuestion that this — not
    starting PRD-0001's implementation, not the GPSRR-capability-mapping backlog writeup — was
    "next." All three PRDs now have matching issues: #5 (0001), #6 (0002), #7 (0003).
14. **Went through EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode again** to design PRD-0001's actual implementation
    (the user picked this as "next" after #7). Two `Explore` agents read `chaosnet.py`,
    `generate_topology.py`, `run_dpsim.py` (full, not excerpts), `test_lab5.py`, `labs/_shared/
    gridfit.py`, `AGENTS.md`, and re-surfaced PRD-0001/0002/0003's exact text, confirming: today's
    fault mechanism is genuinely singular (`DpsimChaosSystem.fault_switch`/`fault_bus`,
    `run_dpsim.py`'s `events[0]`-only read); `test_lab5.py` has zero direct schema coupling so
    extension is safe; and — the one real finding — **PRD-0002 already names a concrete gap in
    PRD-0001's own `ProtectionTripGenerator` sketch** (needs a "counting" trigger-condition variant
    for SA 2016's wind-farm fault-ride-through mechanism, which 0002's own text says to "backport to
    0001's schema"). Plan written to `/home/brianh/.claude/plans/dreamy-mixing-squirrel.md`
    (implements both `trigger_condition` variants now, so 0002 isn't blocked re-opening this file
    later), approved, `ExitPlanMode` called.
15. **Mid-turn, while planning PRD-0001, the user separately asked to merge the PowerMCP PRs after
    creating a combined PR against the real upstream `Power-Agent/PowerMCP`** (not just our fork).
    Finished the PRD-0001 plan first (it was nearly done), then handled this:
    - Launched an implementation agent (background) to build PRD-0001 per the approved plan, commit
      locally, **not push** — see "In flight" below.
    - Confirmed fork `main` was identical to upstream `main` (0 ahead/behind, no conflicts).
    - Opened [`Power-Agent/PowerMCP#52`](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP/pull/52) — a single
      combined PR from `fungible-farm:feat/andes-raw-dyr-loading` (which already had both fixes
      stacked) against the real upstream repo, with a clean, self-contained description (no
      references to our fork's own internal issue/PR numbers, which mean nothing to upstream
      maintainers).
    - Merged `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#3` then `#4` (in that order — #4 was stacked on #3; waited for
      GitHub to recompute `#4`'s `mergeStateStatus` from `UNKNOWN` to `CLEAN` before merging it).
    - **Independently verified the merged state**, not just the individual PRs: fresh clone of
      fork `main` post-merge, `pip install -e . pytest andes`, `pytest tests/ -q` →
      **116 passed, 1 skipped, 2 failed** — the 2 failures are `test_doctor.py`/`test_runner.py`,
      the same pre-existing/environment-dependent failures already confirmed (by the implementation
      agent, via `git stash`) to reproduce identically on unmodified `main` before either PR — i.e.
      the merge introduced zero new regressions.

16. **PRD-0001 implementation completed and independently verified** — commit `488bb36` on branch
    `claude/demo-dashboard`, **committed locally, not pushed** (per instruction; `git status` shows
    the branch 1 commit ahead of `origin/claude/demo-dashboard`). New
    `labs/_shared/scenario_engine/` package (`generators.py`, `detectors.py`, `scenario.py`,
    `scoring.py`, `demo_scenario.py`, ~2100 lines total) plus minimal, backward-compatible extensions
    to `chaosnet.py` (plural `fault_switches`/`fault_buses`, single-target case keeps the exact
    original component name) and `run_dpsim.py` (loops over all scheduled events instead of hard-
    picking `events[0]`). Also folded in `docs/prd/{0001,0002,0003}.md`/`docs/prd/README.md`/
    `docs/VISION.md`'s §14 pointer, which were sitting uncommitted from the planning session (code
    cites them throughout) — `docs/HANDOFF.md` itself was deliberately left uncommitted.
    **Independently re-verified, not just trusted:**
    - Read the actual `chaosnet.py` diff directly — the single-target case is provably
      physics-unchanged (same switch name, same parameters, same connect() call), multi-target is
      additive.
    - Ran `uv run python -m pytest labs/05-.../ labs/_shared/ -v` myself: **11/11 passed**
      (3 existing Lab 5 checks + 8 new: fixture check, 3 direct re-runs of Lab 5's own checks as a
      regression gate, 4 unit tests of both `trigger_condition` variants).
    - Ran `demo_scenario.py --step run` directly and read the raw output: a real DPsim solve
      produces a genuine causal chain (fault at t=0.2004s → measured undervoltage →
      `ProtectionTripGenerator` trip at t=0.2504s), and the four detectors return physically
      plausible, non-fabricated findings (RoCoF spikes during the transient, a persistent ~-2.09°
      inter-bus angle separation post-fault, an oscillation mode at 1.89 Hz, a composite classifier
      score) — not hardcoded-to-pass numbers.
    - Ran `--step check`: prints a genuine two-section `ScoreReport` (generator-realism,
      detector-performance), all entries PASS within tolerance, matching `AGENTS.md`'s
      self-checking convention exactly.
    - One PRD-0002-relevant design note confirmed in the diff: the `ProtectionTripGenerator`
      `trigger_condition` tagged union (`SustainTriggerCondition`/`CountTriggerCondition`) is real
      and unit-tested — the backport 0002 asked for is actually done, not just claimed.

17. **User said "continue"** — picked PRD-0002 (SA 2016) as the next thread without re-asking (three
    prior "next"/"continue" round-trips had already established the pattern; this one read as
    directive rather than a request for options). Before planning, did the primary-source grounding
    PRD-0002 itself required: downloaded AEMO's actual 273-page 2017 "Black System South Australia 28
    September 2016 — Final Report" (same URL already cited in Lab 4's README — **note: the AEMO site
    returns a generic-looking error page, not a clean 404, for a `curl` with no `User-Agent` header;
    a bare download can silently look successful unless the response body is actually checked** — hit
    this exact failure mode once this session before fixing it with a browser UA). Replaced PRD-0002's
    placeholder "grounding TODO" with real, cited facts: the exact 5-fault/6-voltage-dip timeline
    (Table 7), the exact per-wind-farm-group count/window protection thresholds (Table 10 — Group
    A 2-within-2-min, Group B 5-within-2-min, matching this repo's own `CountTriggerCondition`
    shape exactly), and — the one real correction — **the Heywood trip is an impedance-trajectory
    loss-of-synchronism/out-of-step relay, not a power/current threshold** as the PRD had originally
    (reasonably) assumed from GPSRR's simplified paraphrase; the report's own theory section states a
    90° angle-separation threshold for onset of loss of synchronism, which became the real (not
    invented) trigger-condition limit.
18. **Explored `scenario_engine`'s real source in full** (fresh `Explore` pass, not relying on the
    implementing agent's earlier summary) to get exact API before planning PRD-0002's build: confirmed
    multiple condition-triggered generators already work at the driver level;
    confirmed`run_dpsim.py`'s YAML path can't build an `IslandingProtectionGenerator` (hardcodes
    `ProtectionTripGenerator`), so the new scenario needs `demo_scenario.py`'s standalone-driver
    pattern instead; found the one real gap (`MeasurementState` had no angle measurement) and, after
    directly reading `_build_measurement_state()`'s actual body in plan mode, found the fix is a
    two-line addition (`np.angle()` on the same complex phasor already computed for magnitude), not
    new signal-processing work.
19. **Went through EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode again** (a different task from the ANDES/PRD-0001 plans
    — started fresh per the harness's own instruction, didn't try to extend the old plan file). Wrote
    the plan directly from the grounding + Explore results without spawning further sub-agents (same
    judgment call made earlier for the ANDES raw+dyr work, given how much verified context was already
    in hand) — plan mode exited on its own partway through a Phase-3 verification read; treated that
    as the harness's own signal rather than re-entering, and proceeded. Launched an implementation
    agent (background) to build the SA 2016 scenario per the plan — see "In flight" below.

## In flight — do not duplicate this work

An implementation agent is running in the background in **this repo**, building PRD-0002 (SA 2016
scenario) per the (now second) plan at `/home/brianh/.claude/plans/dreamy-mixing-squirrel.md` — read
that file for the exact grounded constants/approach before assuming anything about scope. Told to
commit locally (as a second commit on top of PRD-0001's existing local, unpushed `488bb36`) and
explicitly **not** push. If picking this up cold and no second local commit exists yet, check this
agent's task output before assuming it stalled — note the scenario simulates ~43s of grid time at
200µs EMT steps (~215,000 steps, meaningfully more than PRD-0001's demo's ~2,750), so a longer
wall-clock run before it reports back would not by itself be a sign of a problem.

## Nothing else in flight (PowerMCP thread; PRD-0001 thread)

- `Power-Agent/PowerMCP#52` (combined upstream contribution) is open, unmerged — merging that one is
  entirely the upstream maintainers' call, not ours to make.
- `fungible-farm/PowerMCP#3` and `#4` are merged into our fork's `main`.
- All three PRDs have tracking issues on `nem-poweragent-lab` (#5/#6/#7).
- PRD-0001 is implemented, committed locally (`488bb36`, branch `claude/demo-dashboard`), **not
  pushed** — pushing (and deciding whether/how to fold in `docs/HANDOFF.md`) is the user's call.
  PRD-0003's actual historical scenario (Iberian 2025) remains unimplemented — the natural next
  thread after PRD-0002, if wanted.

## Explicitly not done this session

- The GPSRR-vs-repo capability mapping from step 2 was discussed in chat only — it was not written
  to `docs/backlog/` as its own item. If a future session wants it as a committed, citable artifact
  (separate from the three forward-looking PRDs), that's a new backlog entry, not a PRD, per this
  repo's own `docs/backlog/README.md` distinction (backlog = gap audit, prd = build plan).
- The fault-level/short-circuit gap (pandapower.shortcircuit unused despite being available) has no
  PRD or backlog item yet — named in step 2 above, not yet turned into a tracked artifact.
- None of the three PRDs have been implemented. `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` is unchanged by any of
  this session's work — nothing here is on any lab's current Definition of Done.
- Lab 4 Part C's and Lab 5's existing caveat text were deliberately **not edited** this session —
  0002/0003 reference them but the PRDs' own text says any "see also" pointer back from those files
  is a follow-up edit for whenever the scenarios actually get built, not part of this round.

## Working notes for whoever continues this

- This session's user explicitly confirmed scope before every GitHub-visible action (fork target,
  which repo to fork, which repo issues should land in) rather than having them guessed — worth
  preserving that norm rather than defaulting to guessing on ambiguous "fork X" / "file an issue"
  instructions.
- When fetching a large PDF (GPSRR, ENTSO-E's report) for factual grounding, `WebFetch` on its own
  produced hallucinated-but-confident content once already this session — always cross-check by
  downloading the PDF and reading it directly (`Read` tool supports paginated PDF reading, or
  `pdftotext -layout` + grep for a large document) rather than trusting a single `WebFetch` summary
  of primary-source material that acceptance criteria will later depend on.
