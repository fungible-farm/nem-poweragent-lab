"""Lab 1 (Simple) -- Load-Flow Parameter Fit.

See README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough. Three steps:

    uv run labs/01-simple-loadflow-fit/run.py --step load
    uv run labs/01-simple-loadflow-fit/run.py --step fit
    uv run labs/01-simple-loadflow-fit/run.py --step check

Sandbox note: docs/VISION.md's Lab 1 has a local Phi-4-mini LLM (served by
llama.cpp in a podman pod) choosing each trial load-scaling value over MCP.
A real Phi-4-mini-instruct pod now exists and runs in this sandbox
(kube/llamacpp-phi-pod.yaml, podman-verified -- see kube/README.md), but
this script was not rewired to call it -- docs/VISION.md section 9 names
this lab specifically as the one where "a container is pure overhead," so
the "propose next trial" decision below stays `gridfit.bisection_fit`'s
deterministic bisection policy, named explicitly here and in gridfit.py,
not hidden. The physics on every iteration is a real `pandapower.runpp()`
call either way; that split (LLM/policy proposes, pandapower disposes) is
the actual point of the lab and is unaffected by the swap. Wiring this
script to call the real pod instead is a named, undone follow-up, not a
sandbox impossibility.

The default `--step fit` also (re)writes a network-topology PNG
(sample_network_chart.png) via `pandapower.plotting`
(docs/backlog/0001-topology-and-results-visualization-gap.md item 2 /
docs/backlog/0002's free tier: pandapower.plotting was unused across every
lab despite pandapower being a hard dependency of all of them) -- buses
colored by the fitted network's real solved voltage, TARGET_BUS
highlighted. `--step check` never writes it (it passes
`refresh_chart=False` to `fit_step`, matching Lab 4/5's `refresh_chart`/
`refresh_fixtures` gate); it only asserts the committed PNG exists. See
`_plot_network`'s docstring for the exact pandapower.plotting APIs used.

    (docs/backlog/0001-topology-and-results-visualization-gap.md item 2;
    docs/backlog/0002's free tier recommends exactly this).

    Buses are colored by their real solved `vm_pu` (a genuine
    `pandapower.runpp()` result on `net`, never fabricated -- AGENTS.md

    either would be a new dependency docs/backlog/0002 says to avoid when
    a free-tier option exists). The computed layout is written to

    module (a hard transitive dependency of pandapower itself, required by
    pandapower's own `pyproject.toml`, not a new one this file adds) --
    rather than importing the top-level `geojson` package directly, so
