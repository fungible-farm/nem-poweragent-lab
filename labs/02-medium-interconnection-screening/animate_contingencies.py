"""Animate Lab 2's N-1 contingency screen to a PowerPoint-friendly MP4.

Renders the Lab 2 screen (candidate 250 MW generator at bus 175 of
snem1803.m, then each of the 21 lines local to the connection point taken out
of service and the AC power flow re-solved) as a 1280x720 h264 video: an
intro base-case frame, one frame per contingency showing the screened lines'
loading bars with the dropped line highlighted, and a ~3s closing summary.

Sandbox note (named stand-in): docs/VISION.md's Lab 2 drives every physics
step through a podman-hosted PowerMCP pandapower server; this script makes
the *same* direct pandapower calls in-process (identical, already-named swap
to workflow.py -- see its module docstring). Every value drawn comes from a
real `pp.runpp(net, init="flat")` AC solve of the actual case file; nothing
is fabricated, interpolated, or staged.

Honest finding rendered (matches the committed expected_contingency_table.json
fixture and workflow.check_limits()): the worst bus voltage (0.899 pu at bus
1126) is pre-existing in the base case and unchanged by every outage; 19 of
21 outages leave worst line loading in the pre-existing ~97.8% region (line
1070). The two parallel lines 151/152 (both bus 175 -> bus 608) are the
exception: dropping one overloads the surviving twin to 113.0% / 111.4% -- a
real, contingency-induced thermal breach beyond the 100% limit, and exactly
the "loadings shift as flow re-routes" behaviour this animation is meant to
show. See _summary_text() for the exact wording.
