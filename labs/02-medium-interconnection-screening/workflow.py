"""Lab 2 (Medium) -- Interconnection / Asset-Provisioning Screening.

See README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough. Four steps:

    uv run labs/02-medium-interconnection-screening/workflow.py --step base
    uv run labs/02-medium-interconnection-screening/workflow.py --step contingencies
    uv run labs/02-medium-interconnection-screening/workflow.py --step check-limits
    uv run labs/02-medium-interconnection-screening/workflow.py --step memo [--approve APPROVE]

check-limits also (re)renders a committed sample_contingency_chart.png of the
two planning-band numbers per contingency (see _plot_contingency_table); the
--step check gate asserts that chart exists alongside the JSON fixture.

Sandbox note: docs/VISION.md's Lab 2 runs this as a Microsoft Agent Framework
Sequential+Concurrent workflow, calling a podman-hosted PowerMCP pandapower
server for every physics step. A real PowerMCP pandapower pod now exists and
runs in this sandbox (kube/powermcp-pandapower-pod.yaml, podman-verified --
see kube/README.md), but this script was not rewired to call it over MCP --
that rewiring is a named, undone follow-up, not a sandbox impossibility. The
four steps below are the same sequential/concurrent shape (a sequential
base-case solve, a *genuinely* concurrent N-1 fan-out via
ProcessPoolExecutor, a sequential limit-check, then a gated memo step)
implemented as direct pandapower calls in-process instead of MCP tool calls.
The physics, the parallelism, and the human-in-the-loop gate are all real;
only the transport (MCP-over-a-pod vs. an in-process function call) is
swapped, and that swap is the one named in docs/VISION.md section 9 itself
("for a single interactive fit... a container is pure overhead") -- Lab 2 is
the first place a live PowerMCP pod would earn its keep, and this file is
written so dropping in an MCP client call in place of `run_contingency()` is
the only change needed later.
